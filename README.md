# P2 - Recommender Systems

*Project 2 source code for B2-24.*
Implementation of a recommender system in a web application.

*To run the server:*
1. If first time: ```npm install```
2. ```npm run start```
3. Locally running on http://localhost:3000

Due to Nodemon (NPM package) the server will automatically refresh with new updates in the files.
This is done to make the development & testing process easier.
